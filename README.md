# WBANSimulator
This academic project helps visualize the functioning of Wireless Body Area Networks and provides a basis for actual implementations.

In addition, from technical point of view, the project demonstrates the following concepts:
* Use of Java Swing framework for interactively placing graphical objects on a co-ordinate plane.
* Use of trigonometrical calculations to draw arrows.
* Visual implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
* Use of background threads and timers.
